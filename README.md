## Basic physics simulation made in plain JS *(I used my own library SGL.js for rendering)*
* This is a really minimal physics simulation and probably not pleasing to your **eyes**.
* But still if you want to try this, Clone this project and open the `entry.html` file.
* The physics is simulated using **`verlet's integration`**
* **x<sub>n + 1</sub> = x<sub>n</sub> + v + aÎ”t<sup>2<sup>**
#### Should you care?
#### no.
* I sometimes wonder, why I don't publish any **actual** good projects but instead, I publish those who took like 3 hours only.
